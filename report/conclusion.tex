\label{sec:conclusion}

Throughout this project, we have expanded our knowledge in the domains of Natural Language Processing (NLP), multi-class and multimodal classification, as well as honed our skills in Deep Learning using different techniques. \\

Initially, we navigated the Google Colaboratory notebooks for data visualization throughout  different graphs and u-maps as well as our CNN models utilizing Google colab' GPU. Subsequently, we explored the OpenAI tool clip which excels in understanding and connecting vision and language. \\

In the realm of Data Science, we conducted a comprehensive study where we conceptualized, implemented, and evaluated classification models. As discussed in the previous sections of the report, while the achieved performances are deemed satisfactory, we acknowledge that there are numerous avenues for improvement yet to bed.
